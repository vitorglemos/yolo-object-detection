# Yolo Object Detection

## Project 

This repository contains the complete pipeline for creating, training and testing your own object detection model using Yolov3. 
YOLO is one of the faster object detection algorithms out there. This Framework helps YOLO to detect custom objects, in Videos and Images. YOLOv3 is a real-time, single-stage object detection model that builds on YOLOv2 with several improvements. Improvements include the use of a new backbone network, Darknet-53 that utilises residual connections.

## Environments

YOLOv3 may be run in any of the following up-to-date verified environments (with all dependencies including [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda)/[CUDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn), [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) preinstalled):

- **Google Colab**: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"></a>

- **What types of GPUs are available in Colab?**
The types of GPUs that are available in Colab vary over time. This is necessary for Colab to be able to provide access to these resources for free. The GPUs available in Colab often include Nvidia K80s, T4s, P4s and P100s. There is no way to choose what type of GPU you can connect to in Colab at any given time. Users who are interested in more reliable access to Colabâ€™s fastest GPUs may be interested in Colab Pro.

- **Kaggle** provides free access to NVidia K80 GPUs in kernels: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/"><img src="https://kaggle.com/static/images/open-in-kaggle.svg" alt="Open In Kaggle"></a>
- **What types of GPUs are available in Kaggle?** The GPUs available in Colab often include NVidia K80 GPUs. The time limit for access to GPUs per user is 30 hours per month.
